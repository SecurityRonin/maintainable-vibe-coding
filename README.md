# Maintainable Vibe Coding

**Ship fast without breaking things.**

A practical workflow tutorial book teaching battle-tested best practices for modern web development using v0, Supabase, GitHub, and Claude Code CLI with superpowers.

## 🎯 What This Book Teaches

This isn't a React tutorial. This is a **workflow tutorial**.

You'll learn the exact process to go from idea to production:

1. **Design Phase:** Rapid prototyping with v0
2. **Infrastructure:** Backend setup with Supabase (auth + data)
3. **Version Control:** Professional GitHub workflow
4. **Local Development:** Claude Code CLI with superpowers for maintainable rapid development
5. **Deployment:** Ship to production

By the end, you'll have:
- Built a complete full-stack application
- Learned to ship features in days, not weeks
- Established patterns for maintainable codebases
- Mastered tools that amplify your productivity
