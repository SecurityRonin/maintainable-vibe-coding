# Introduction

"Move fast and break things" is dead. "Move slow and build it right" is too slow. **Vibe coding is the third way.**

This book teaches you a practical workflow for shipping modern web applications fast, without accumulating technical debt. It's not about React code—it's about the **process** that lets you build maintainable software at high velocity.

## What You'll Learn

Throughout this book, you'll build **TaskFlow**, a complete team task management application, using five proven phases:

1. **Design Phase:** Rapid prototyping with v0
2. **Infrastructure:** Backend setup with Supabase (auth + data)
3. **Version Control:** Professional GitHub workflow
4. **Local Development:** Claude Code CLI with superpowers for maintainable rapid development
5. **Deployment:** Ship to production

By the end, you'll have:

- Built a complete full-stack application
- Learned to ship features in days, not weeks
- Established patterns for maintainable codebases
- Mastered tools that amplify your productivity

## Who This Is For

You'll love vibe coding if you:

- Want to ship quickly but hate technical debt
- Like AI assistance but don't trust autopilot
- Value pragmatism over perfectionism
- Ship side projects or production systems
- Work solo or with a team

Let's begin.
