# What You'll Build

Throughout this book, you'll build **TaskFlow**, a complete team task management application. Here's what it looks like and how it works.

## TaskFlow: Team Task Management

**Live Demo:** [taskflow-tutorial.vercel.app](https://taskflow-tutorial.vercel.app)

**Source Code:** [github.com/SecurityRonin/taskflow-tutorial](https://github.com/SecurityRonin/taskflow-tutorial)

## Features

### User Authentication
- Email/password sign up and login
- Magic link authentication
- Social auth (Google, GitHub)
- Password reset flow
- Session management

### Task Management
- Create, edit, delete tasks
- Assign tasks to team members
- Set priorities (low, medium, high, urgent)
- Add labels and tags
- Rich text descriptions
- File attachments

### Real-Time Collaboration
- See team members' changes instantly
- Live presence indicators
- Optimistic UI updates
- Conflict resolution

### Organization
- Kanban board view
- List view
- Calendar view
- Filters and search
- Bulk operations

### Dashboard
- Task statistics
- Team activity feed
- Personal task summary
- Upcoming deadlines

## Technical Showcase

TaskFlow demonstrates every aspect of the workflow:

### From v0
- Responsive dashboard layout
- Drag-and-drop kanban board
- Modal forms and dialogs
- Empty states and loading states
- Mobile-first design

### From Supabase
- Email/password authentication
- OAuth providers
- PostgreSQL database with proper indexing
- Row Level Security for data isolation
- Real-time subscriptions
- File storage for attachments

### From GitHub Workflow
- Feature branch development
- Pull request reviews
- GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Automated deployments
- Version tagging

### From Claude Code + Superpowers
- TDD implementation of auth flows
- Brainstormed feature architecture
- Systematic debugging
- Code review workflows
- Refactoring with confidence

### From Vercel Deployment
- Automatic preview deployments
- Environment variable management
- Edge functions for API routes
- Analytics and monitoring
- Zero-downtime deploys

## Development Timeline

Building TaskFlow following this workflow takes:

**Week 1 (MVP):**
- Day 1: v0 design + Supabase setup (2-3 hours)
- Day 2: GitHub + local setup + auth (2-3 hours)
- Day 3-4: Core task CRUD (4-5 hours)
- Day 5: Kanban board + drag-drop (2-3 hours)
- Day 6: Polish + deployment (2 hours)

**Total MVP:** 15-18 hours over 6 days

**Week 2 (Full features):**
- Real-time collaboration
- File attachments
- Advanced filters
- Team management
- Analytics dashboard

**Total Production-Ready:** 30-35 hours over 2 weeks

Compare this to traditional development:
- Design in Figma: 2-3 days
- Implement design: 5-7 days
- Build backend: 7-10 days
- Testing: 3-5 days
- Deployment setup: 1-2 days

**Traditional timeline:** 4-6 weeks for the same result

## What You'll Learn

By building TaskFlow, you'll master:

### Technical Skills
- Next.js 13+ app directory
- Shadcn UI components
- Supabase client & RLS
- Real-time subscriptions
- TypeScript best practices
- Testing strategies

### Workflow Skills
- Design-first development
- TDD in practice
- AI-assisted coding
- Git workflow
- Continuous deployment
- Production monitoring

### Decision-Making
- When to use v0 vs custom code
- How to structure Supabase schemas
- Where to add tests
- When to refactor
- How to debug with Claude Code

## After TaskFlow

Once you complete TaskFlow, you'll be able to:

✅ Ship new projects in days, not months

✅ Add features without breaking existing ones

✅ Onboard teammates quickly

✅ Refactor with confidence

✅ Handle production issues calmly

✅ Build side projects that you actually finish

## Variations

The tutorial builds TaskFlow, but you can apply this to:

- **SaaS products** - Subscription management, billing, analytics
- **Internal tools** - Admin dashboards, data entry, reporting
- **E-commerce** - Product catalogs, checkout, inventory
- **Social apps** - Feeds, comments, notifications
- **Content platforms** - Publishing, moderation, search

The workflow works for any web application.

T> **Real Complexity**
T>
T> TaskFlow isn't a toy example. It has real-world complexity: auth, permissions, real-time, file uploads, testing. That's intentional. You'll learn patterns that scale.
