# Chapter 3: What You'll Build

Throughout this book, you'll build **ReadStack**—a personal "read later" URL manager.

## The Problem ReadStack Solves

You have 100+ browser tabs open. Articles to read "later." But later never comes.

Browser bookmarks become a graveyard. You need something simpler.

**ReadStack solves this.**

## What ReadStack Does

**Save URLs in 3 seconds:**
1. Paste URL
2. Automatically fetches title, description, preview image
3. Add tags/notes (optional)
4. Save

**Organize by status:**
- **To Read** - Your reading queue
- **Reading** - Currently reading
- **Archived** - Finished

**Additional features:**
- Tag organization
- 1-5 star ratings
- Personal notes
- Works on mobile and desktop

## What ReadStack Is NOT

We're keeping it simple:

❌ No teams or sharing
❌ No real-time collaboration
❌ No AI summarization
❌ No social features
❌ No browser extension (yet)

One user. Core features only. Actually useful.

## Why ReadStack Is Perfect for Learning

**Simple data model:**
One table: `articles`. That's it.

**Immediate value:**
You'll actually use it. Save articles as you learn.

**Complete workflow:**
You'll experience all five phases: Design → Infrastructure → Git → Development → Deployment.

**Foundation for more:**
The patterns work for any CRUD app: recipe managers, workout trackers, note apps.

**Time-boxed:**
2 hours 50 minutes from start to deployed app. Clear milestones every 20-30 minutes.

## Development Timeline

| Phase | Time | What You Build |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **Planning** | 30 min | Architecture design |
| **Implementation Plan** | 20 min | Task breakdown |
| **UI Design** | 20 min | v0 components |
| **Backend Setup** | 20 min | Supabase auth + database |
| **Implementation** | 60 min | Full app with tests |
| **Deployment** | 20 min | Live on internet |
| **Total** | **170 min** | **Complete app** |

**Traditional approach:** 2-3 weeks

**Lines you write:** ~30 (prompts and decisions)

**Lines generated:** ~2,000 (components, logic, tests)

## What You'll Learn

**Technical:**
- Next.js App Router
- shadcn/ui components
- Supabase + Row Level Security
- TypeScript
- Server Components vs Client Components
- Form handling

**Workflow:**
- Design-first development
- AI-assisted planning (brainstorming)
- Quality-gated development
- TDD in practice (test before code)
- Git workflow
- Continuous deployment

**Decision-making:**
- When to use v0 vs custom code
- How to structure databases
- When to refactor (when quality gates tell you)

## What Success Looks Like

At the end, you'll have:

**Deployed app at readstack-yourname.vercel.app:**
- Working authentication
- Save URLs with automatic metadata
- Filter by status, organize by tags
- Rate and add notes
- Responsive design

**Plus:**
- GitHub repo with clean history
- All tests passing
- Zero technical debt
- Ready to enhance

**Most importantly:**
- Understanding of the workflow
- Confidence to build your next project
- Proof that quality and speed aren't opposites

## Ready?

Next, Chapter 4 gets you set up with tools and accounts.

Chapters 5-9 teach the five-phase workflow.

Chapters 10-16 walk you through building ReadStack.
