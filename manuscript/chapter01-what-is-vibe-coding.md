# Chapter 1: What is Maintainable Vibe Coding?

"Move fast and break things" is dead. "Move slow and build it right" is too slow. There's a third way.

## The Problem

You've seen both extremes:

**Move fast:**
- Ship quickly, no tests
- Technical debt everywhere
- Can't change code without breaking things

**Move slow:**
- Perfect architecture before starting
- Analysis paralysis
- Never actually ship

Both fail. One creates unmaintainable messes. The other never ships.

## The Solution: Maintainable Vibe Coding

Build fast AND maintainable. Not one or the other. Both.

**How:**
- Use AI to speed up (v0, Claude Code)
- Use quality gates to maintain standards (automatic tests, code review)
- Use the right tools for each job (Supabase, GitHub, Vercel)

**Result:** Ship in 3 hours what normally takes 2-3 weeks. With tests. With clean code.

## The Five-Phase Workflow

Every project follows five phases:

**1. Design (v0)** - 20 minutes
Generate production UI components from text descriptions.

**2. Infrastructure (Supabase)** - 20 minutes
Backend setup: authentication, database, API.

**3. Version Control (GitHub)** - 10 minutes
Professional git workflow from day one.

**4. Development (Claude Code)** - 60-90 minutes
AI-assisted development with automatic quality checks.

**5. Deployment (Vercel)** - 20 minutes
Push to production. Automatic deploys on every commit.

**Total:** 2-3 hours from idea to deployed app.

## What You'll Build

**ReadStack** - A personal "read later" app for saving and organizing articles.

**Features:**
- Save URLs (automatic title/description)
- Organize by status (To Read, Reading, Archived)
- Add tags, ratings, notes
- Mobile and desktop

**Time:** 2 hours 50 minutes total.

**What you'll write manually:** ~30 lines (mostly prompts)

**What AI generates:** ~2,000 lines (components, logic, tests)

## Who This Is For

You want to:
- Ship quickly without creating technical debt
- Use AI assistance without losing control
- Build real projects that work in production
- Learn modern web development workflow

You don't need to be an expert. You need to know what you want to build. The tools handle how.

## What This Isn't

❌ **Not "let AI write everything"** - You're the architect. AI assists.

❌ **Not "skip the tests"** - Tests are enforced automatically.

❌ **Not "YOLO deployment"** - Quality gates ensure production-ready code.

## What's Next

Chapter 2 explains why each phase exists and why they're in this specific order.

Chapter 3 shows you exactly what ReadStack does.

Chapter 4 gets you set up with tools and accounts.

Chapters 5-9 teach the five-phase workflow.

Chapters 10-16 walk you through building ReadStack.

By the end, you'll have a deployed app and a workflow you can use for any project.

Let's begin.
