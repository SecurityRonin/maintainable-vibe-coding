# Complete Tutorial: Building TaskFlow

Welcome to the hands-on tutorial! This is where theory meets practice.

## What We're Building

**TaskFlow** is a team task management application featuring:

- 🎨 Modern, responsive UI designed with v0
- 🔐 User authentication with Supabase Auth
- 📊 Real-time task updates across team members
- 🏷️ Task assignment, labels, and priorities
- 📱 Mobile-friendly interface
- 🚀 Deployed to production on Vercel

## Why This Project?

TaskFlow showcases every part of the maintainable vibe coding workflow:

- **v0 Design:** Dashboard, kanban boards, user profiles
- **Supabase:** Auth, real-time updates, Row Level Security
- **GitHub:** Version control, CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- **Claude Code:** Complex features like drag-drop, filters, search
- **TDD:** Critical paths like task assignment and permissions

## Tutorial Structure

This tutorial follows the exact workflow you'll use in your own projects:

### Step 1: Design Phase (v0)
Design the entire application interface before writing any code. Learn to iterate quickly and export production-ready Next.js components.

### Step 2: Supabase Setup
Set up authentication, database schema, and Row Level Security policies. Get your backend running before touching the frontend.

### Step 3: GitHub Init
Create the repository, push the v0 export, and set up GitHub Actions for deployment.

### Step 4: Clone and Setup
Clone locally, configure environment variables, and verify everything runs.

### Step 5: Claude Brainstorming
Use Claude Code with superpowers to plan feature implementation. Learn to design before coding.

### Step 6: Implementing Auth
TDD implementation of authentication flow. Watch tests guide development.

### Step 7: Building Features
Implement core features: task creation, assignment, real-time updates, drag-drop.

### Step 8: Deployment
Deploy to Vercel, configure environment, monitor production.

### Step 9: Iteration
Add new features post-launch. See how the workflow handles changes.

## What You'll Learn

By completing this tutorial, you'll master:

- **v0 Workflow:** Designing complete UIs visually
- **Supabase Patterns:** Auth, real-time, RLS best practices
