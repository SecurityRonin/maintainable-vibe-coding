# Maintainable Vibe Coding

**Ship fast without breaking things.**

Welcome to a practical guide for building modern web applications using battle-tested workflows and tools that amplify your productivity.

## What You'll Learn

This isn't a React tutorial. This is a **workflow tutorial**.

You'll learn the exact process to go from idea to production:

1. **Design Phase:** Rapid prototyping with v0
2. **Infrastructure:** Backend setup with Supabase (auth + data)
3. **Version Control:** Professional GitHub workflow
4. **Local Development:** Claude Code CLI with superpowers for maintainable rapid development
5. **Deployment:** Ship to production

## Who This Is For

- Developers who want to ship faster without sacrificing quality
- Engineers tired of reinventing the wheel for every project
- Teams looking for proven workflows
- Anyone who's heard "move fast and break things" and thought "there must be a better way"

## The Promise
